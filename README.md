Here we provide a step-by-step guide to the **dynamAedes** package, a unified modelling framework for
invasive *Aedes* mosquitoes. In this package, the users can apply the stochastic, time-discrete and spatially-explicit population dynamical model developed in Da Re et. al 2021 (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2020.101180) for *Aedes aegypti* mosquitoes and now expanded for other three species: *Ae. albopictus*, *Ae. japonicus* and *Ae. koreicus*

This stage-based model is informed by temperature and photoperiod and can be applied to three different spatial
scales: punctual, local and regional. These spatial scales consider different degrees of spatial complexity and data availability, by accounting for both active and passive dispersal of the modeled mosquito species as well as for the heterogeneity of temperature data.
